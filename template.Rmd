I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
```{r}
Q2_data_car = c(67, 50, 85, 43, 64, 35, 47, 97, 58, 58, 10, 56, 50)
Q2_data_bike = c(45, 39, 25, 47, 49, 5, 70, 99, 74, 37, 99, 35, 8, 59)
names(Q2_data_bike) = 'bike'
names(Q2_data_car) = 'car'
boxplot(Q2_data_bike,Q2_data_car,horizontal = TRUE)
```
